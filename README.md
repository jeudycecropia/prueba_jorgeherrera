===================

Repo for Jorge's technical test

The app is built with yeoman. Please visit this site if you have problems running the app. http://yeoman.io/

I believe you have to run 'npm install' and 'bower install' to install all the dependencies and application components

Type 'grunt server' in console to open a server and watch the app

Type 'grunt test' to run jasmine tests
